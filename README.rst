Welcome to Indivo™
==================

Indivo™ is the original personally controlled health record (PCHR) system. 
A PCHR enables an individual to own and manage a complete, secure, digital 
copy of her health and wellness information. Indivo integrates health 
information across sites of care and over time. Indivo™ is free and 
open-source, uses open, unencumbered standards, and is actively deployed 
in diverse settings.
